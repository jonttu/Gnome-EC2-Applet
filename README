Gnome panel applet for monitoring and controlling Amazons EC2 instances. The apllet shows the state (running, pending, stopping or stopped) of EC2 instances and allows the user to change this state.

The applet can use multiple instances. The instances are entered in the i-xxxxx format, which means instances that are already reserved in EC2. The user can save in costs by shutting down the instances when not needed. If multiple instances are used, the icon shows the status of the first instance and the details of each instance can be seen in the tooltip.

The applet may have multiple instances in the panels and each can be configured with separate EC2 instances to monitor and control.
